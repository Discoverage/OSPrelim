using c++ code prelim.cpp

rr, sjf, srtf, hiwalay na func rtq sa rr
have a calculated time in rr, where it will calculate the mean, median to compute the time Quantum itself


na kung saan naglalaman ito ng code
algorithm

1. round robin
2. shortest job first
3. shortest remaining time first
4. recommended time quantum (where it will calculate the mean, median to compute the time Quantum itself, put it at the very top)

MAKE SURE THAT THE VARIAbles are named like (AT, BT etc.)

make sure na ito ay parang ieencapsulate sa isang lalgyanan na ang pangalan ay process

have a calculate time in round robin. icacalculate nya muna ung median or mean ng burst time para makapagcalculate ng quantum time

u need to display the table values

table looks (pid, arrival, burst, completion, turnaround, waiting)

under the table
average turn around time and average waiting time


u dont need to ask
nakainititate na dapat sya sa main


(dapat magakakasunod ung display ng table na ito pagtapos ng main)
recommeneded time quantum
round robin
shortest job first
shortest remaining time first
main


ARRIVAL TIME:
4, 2, 3, 6, 1, 5, 8, 7,

BURST TIME:
53, 43, 18, 16, 44, 73, 99, 27

ALL OF THAT WILL HAVE IN THE ALGORITHM


THE OUTPUT WILL DISPLAY:
1. round robin
2. shortest job first
3. shortest remaining time first


use abbreviations like pid bt, tat on output, and fix the completion time
